# Fitness Tracking Web Application

A comprehensive fitness tracking web application designed to complement Apple Watch and other fitness devices by providing detailed manual data entry and progress tracking capabilities.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Create a user-friendly interface for manually logging detailed workout information
- Track comprehensive fitness metrics including diet and workout stats
- Provide visual progress tracking through charts and historical data
- Serve as a learning platform for web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

### Long-term Vision
- Build a robust data persistence system (migrate from localStorage to database)
- Implement timestamp-based progress tracking for historical analysis
- Create interactive charts and visualizations for fitness data
- Develop a responsive design that works seamlessly across devices



### Future Enhancements
- Database integration for robust data storage
- Timestamp tracking for all entries
- Advanced data visualization with interactive charts
- Export functionality for fitness data
- Integration capabilities with fitness device APIs

## Getting Started
